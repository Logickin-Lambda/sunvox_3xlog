# Checkpoint B

Great! Now you have completed this chapter, building memory modules for storing your data! Let's grab yourself my toolkit and test your knowledge over my riddles!

## 3xLog Tool kit B - Memories, Latches and Flip flops:

Here are my commonly used modules for basic memory storages, including a SR latch, D/T Flip Flops, and an Edge Triggered Counter. Some of the modules require two inputs, so you may use my two "Extract" modules to correctly convert the signals for the memory circuits. For the two input modules, they have a code prepended to the name of the module, with the convention of two channels separated by a slash "/". For example: D/CLK means the left channel takes the data, while clock signal for the right.
