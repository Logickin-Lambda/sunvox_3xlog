# Checkpoint A

Congrats! You have reached the first checkpoint of the 3xLog. Now you have learnt the basics of the digital combination logic and its SunVox implementation. Before moving on to the more complex stuff like memory circuits and state machine, you may do these riddle to practice what you have learnt. I will order them by difficulty. It is recommended to do all of the introductory and easy level first if you want to actually build something on SunVox. In addition, let me share the logic processing modules, so that everyone can use it out of the box.

### 3xLog Tool kit A - Memories, Latches and Flip flops:
- Coming Soon

### Logical Riddle:
- Coming Soon? (It will take a long time because I am still thinking what is the best way for the validations)
