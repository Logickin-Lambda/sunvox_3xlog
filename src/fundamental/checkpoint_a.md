# Checkpoint A

Congrats! You have reached the first checkpoint of the 3xLog. Now you have learnt the basics of the digital combination logic and its SunVox implementation. Before moving on to the more complex stuff like memory circuits and state machine, you may do these riddle to practice what you have learnt. I will order them by difficulty. It is recommended to do all of the introductory and easy level first if you want to actually build something on SunVox. In addition, let me share the logic processing modules, so that everyone can use it out of the box.

### 3xLog Tool kit A - Logic Gates, Sources and Maths:
Here are all the commonly used building block for the combinational logic circuits. Some of them are basically the default modules, but they save you some pain aligning the color coding and naming conventions. Feel free to grab it and mess around it!
