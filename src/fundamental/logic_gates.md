# Logic gates

## Overview

Fundamentally, every computers are made with some kind of logic gates, which is the simplest component to calculates things. In the real world, logic gates are made with a bunch of transistors. In layman terms, transistor is like a switch (there are more than that, but let's keeping it simple). When you press the switch, the light is on, and vice versa. Instead of flicking the switch manually, electronics switch on transistors using voltages.

## Binary and Truth Table

Without mentioning what is a Binary and Truth Table, it is meaningless to teach the following since they are the vital concept and figures to show how logic gates work. 

Computers don't calculates math like us, using the decimal number system; under the hood, they are just all low state or high state; some call it 0s or 1s; some call it true or false, and they are all describe the same thing, the binary signal. For now, let we use 0 for no DC signal, while 1 for DC signal with +128 DC offset in amplifiers.
