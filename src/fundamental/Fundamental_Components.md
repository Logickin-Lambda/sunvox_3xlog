# Understand The Fundamentals
In this chapter, you will know the most commonly used module for digital signal processing and how to use them to build simple combinational logic circuits.

After you have learnt this chapter, you can do most of the calculation in SunVox, such as selecting a specific signal path, and calculate with math expression, which covers most of the knowledge you would need for designing you module with special behavior.

At the end of the chapter, I will post all of the modules you have gone through, so you donâ€™t need to re-invent the wheel and you can do logic calculation out of the box. The related riddles are also provided once I have more and less completed the logbook.
