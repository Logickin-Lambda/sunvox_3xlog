### It is no longer a Myth!

Introducing, The Logickin’s Logical Logbook (3xLog)! A full documentation about how to implement logic circuit using SunVox! In this tutorial, you will learn not only the SunVox implementation, but also the real world of Digital Logic, Computer Architecture, or even Computer Algorithms. We start by building simple components like the logic gates and simple arithmetic modules, for the fundamental idea of logic processing in SunVox. Then we will move on the memory circuits like latches and flip flops, to help you to build a state machine. After that, I will move on to the more complex circuit like ALU, Registers, Graphics, algorithms, etc, and a bit of story about how I build a fully functional 16bit computer, to guide you how to achieve such a complex project.

After this tutorial, you will have enough knowledge to build some logic circuits, from implementing some interesting behaviors for your modules, to making your own interactive game, with only using SunVox Modules.

I hoped that this material can makes SunVox not only a power Music Tracker, but also a fun, educational learning material for anyone who want to learning how computers work.
