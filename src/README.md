### It is no longer a Myth!

Introducing, The Logickin’s Logical Logbook (3xLog)! A full documentation about how to implement logic circuit using SunVox! In this tutorial, you will learn not only the SunVox implementation, but also the real world of Digital Logic, Computer Architecture, or even Computer Algorithms. We start by building simple components like the logic gates and simple arithmetic modules, for the fundamental idea of logic processing in SunVox. Then we will move on the memory circuits like latches and flip flops, to help you to build a state machine. After that, I will move on to the more complex circuit like ALU, Registers, Graphics, algorithms, etc, and a bit of story about how I build a fully functional 16bit computer, to guide you how to achieve such a complex project.

After this tutorial, you will have enough knowledge to build some logic circuits, from implementing some interesting behaviors for your modules, to making your own interactive game, with only using SunVox Modules.

I hoped that this material can makes SunVox not only a power Music Tracker, but also a fun, educational learning material for anyone who want to learning how computers work.

### But... why make a remaster from the original Logbook?

Some might ask what happened to my original 3xLog, and why I had stopped update it for a really long time. Since the Graphic Chapter, I had a lot of struggle on writing the tutorial. 

The first problem was about the performance of Wordpress. For some reason, once the editor has couple of paragraph blocks with one or two image, the editor lagged so badly to a point editing is painfully slow, and moving the order of an image takes a few tens of seconds which is ridiculous. Owing to this issue, I gave up expending some of the topic 

The second issue is the sustainability. This logbook only works when I use my current website theme, using circuit.js with hardcoded location, paired with a specific commercial, close-sourced plugin, without any backups. This is really dangerous, as if I have a style change to my website, or change the domain name, or my website has shutdown, the whole log book will be vanished from the world, losing most of the interesting hacks and tricks to make some "smart" SunVox modules.

Hence, for these problems, I decided to use my favorite guide book format, the rust mdbook, which it provides a clean style to work with, while the markdown format can let me writing down all the SunVox knowledge within a couple of minutes, using my ide of choice. In addition, I can make a backup using any git repositories to store my logbook off-site, so that not only others can expend the book with pull-requests and fix any error with issues, but also keeping it safe from being destroyed if my blog has shutdown in various reason.

### hmmm... I have found an issue

Despite being a former Electronic and Computer Engineering student, and currently a software developer, I might still make mistakes on my tutorial, so please help me find any mistakes and point that out on the issue tab of my repository for a correction. If you have any suggestion, please tell me about it as well, so that to further improve this tutorial.
