# Checkpoint C

Finally, the is such a milestone because not only you have now understood how to make simple shapes, using multiplexing and geometric transforms, but also I have finally break through the struggle on writing this sections due to the problem of wordpress. Let us have some fun on making other patterns or logos before moving on to the upcoming section!

## 3xLog Tool kit C - Graphic Generators and Transformation Functions:
![Graphic Modules](../images/graphics/graphics%20toolkit.png)
Losing in mind on the graphic stuff? No worries! I have provided a handful of graphic modules so that you can generate basic shape out of the box! You may encounter symbols like "n>" and ">n" for some of the modules because these modules have special input and output signal due to the use of Nyquist Clock Serialization. All you need to do is to connect the modules with "n>" to ">n" to properly render the elements.
