# Graphics

Finally, we have reached the long waited topic, graphic in SunVox! You will know how to make basic shapes and geometry transformation.

This topic actually has no much practical applications since it requires many modules thus a high CPU usage; however, it is a good party trick to show off about your SunVox knowledge, showing others that you can build a fully functional seven segment display to show your calculations, or making oscilloscope music.
