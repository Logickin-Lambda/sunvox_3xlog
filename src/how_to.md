# How To...

Before reading, I would recommended the following settings to have the best experience:

**I Recommend reading the logbook using FireFox with zoom level of 130 - 140**

Due to how mdbook spacing works, half of the space are used for padding, that meas all of the content will be located at the middle of the screen; this can be problematic for some of my original image which they can be too small for reading. Zooming will solve most of the problem; you may also view the images by right clicking into a new tab which will show the full resolution.
