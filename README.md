# 3xLog Remaster
This is the remaster version of my original 3xLog since I have gotten too many problem during the original format.

The first problem was about the performance of Wordpress. For some reason, once the editor has couple of paragraph blocks with one or two image, the editor lagged so badly to a point editing is painfully slow, and moving the order of an image takes a few tens of seconds which is ridiculous. Owing to this issue, I gave up expending some of the topic 

The second issue is the sustainability. This logbook only works when I use my current website theme, using circuit.js with hardcoded location, paired with a specific commercial, close-sourced plugin, without any backups. This is really dangerous, as if I have a style change to my website, or change the domain name, or my website has shutdown, the whole log book will be vanished from the world, losing most of the interesting hacks and tricks to make some "smart" SunVox modules.

Hence, for these problems, I decided to use my favorite guide book format, the rust mdbook, which it provides a clean style to work with, while the markdown format can let me writing down all the SunVox knowledge within a couple of minutes, using my ide of choice. In addition, I can make a backup using any git repositories to store my logbook off-site, so that not only others can expend the book with pull-requests and fix any error with issues, but also keeping it safe from being destroyed if my blog has shutdown in various reason. 

The content of this version will be improved a lot more than the original, which was filling with unseen typos, grammatical mistake, and a lot of unclear explanation that leads to confusion. I am not saying this will be the perfect version of my 3xLog, but this will be better than before.

I have recently set up GitHub Action for deployment; although it is not completed yet and I am working on deploying the Logbook into my website, you may temporary have a peek at the following github pages:
